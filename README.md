## css
- css-style sheets
- a list of CSS rules/rule sets
- It consists of selectors, curly braces and declarations
## inline elements
- Don't take up any more room than their content needs
- span, img, strong, em, a and more...
## block-level elements
- Take up the whole width of a page regardless of content
- p, div, h1, h2, h3, ul, li and more... 

inline elements can be nested in block-level elements, but block level elements cannot be nested inside in-line elements.
- block level elements can have margin all the way around the elements, but inline elements can only have margins left and the right of the elements.


## cascade
```Inheritance```
- HTML elements can inherit css properties that are applied to their parents.
