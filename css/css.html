    <p>A star is an astronomical object comprising a luminous spheroid 
        of plasma held together by its gravity. The nearest star to Earth 
        is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night,
         but their immense distances from Earth make them appear as fixed 
         points of light. The most prominent stars have been categorised 
         into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars
          have proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues 
          that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar 
          designations. The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 
          to 1024 stars. Still, most are invisible to the naked eye from 
          Earth,including all individual stars outside our galaxy,
          the Milky Way</p>
